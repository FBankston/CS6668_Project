Over time, Big Data has evolved to become one of the key components for enterprise growth. Big Data structures allow for organizations to process and operate upon massive amounts of data in order to make better business decisions and find hidden patterns within the data. Such data will often be sensitive and require a platform built for efficient and secure delivery. Therefore, network security should always be at the forefront of concerns when dealing when any type of Big Data scheme. Network security in this context faces some unique challenges because of the unique systems and adaptations created to support Big Data. This paper will give an introduction to Big Data systems and the unique kinds of challenges and attacks they face. The paper will then give a survey over the common and standard prevention mechanisms that are employed to protect our sensitive Big Data schemes.
